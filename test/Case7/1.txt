chapter	one
portland 1	oregon 1	how	did	he	end	up	here 1
damien	lambert	had	been	at	the	top	of	his	class	in	law
school	in	seattle 1	well 2	okay 1	second	place 1	his	roommate
never	failed	to	beat	him	out	in	everything 1	and	she	spent
about	half	as	much	time	as	him	doing	it 1	but	now	damien
is	here 1	in	portland 1
running	away 1
in	fact 4	he’s	bumming	a	couch	off	of	a	friend	he	hasn’t
talked	to	since	they	went	to	the	same	stuffy	all-boys	high
school	in	the	same	rural	midwestern	town	all	those	years
ago 1	his	friend 1	or	maybe	he	should	say	his	acquaintance 1
has	spent	the	entire	afternoon	smoking	pot	in	the	small
apartment	where	damien’s	crashing	temporarily 1	damien
just	got	here	a	few	hours	ago 1	and	he	is	already	regretting
a	lot	about	this	situation 1	but	he	doesn’t	regret	leaving
seattle 1	yet 4
“so	you	like…	dropped	out	of	law	school 1	rough 1
man 1”	ethan	says	unhelpfully 1	repeating	the	same
sentiment	he’s	already	repeated	several	times	that
afternoon 1	“yeah 1	you	can	chill	here	as	long	as	you	want 1”
he	makes	a	broad	gesture	at	the	refrigerator 1	“feel	free	to
eat	whatever	you	find	in	there 1”

damien’s	standing	at	the	fridge 1	door	open 1	and	it’s
completely	empty	except	a	row	of	colorfully-labeled	beer
bottles 1	a	jar	of	pickles 1	and	a	carton	of	milk	that	he
suspects	is	out	of	date	if	he	bothered	to	check 1	he	closes
the	door	and	runs	a	hand	through	his	sandy	brown	hair
anxiously 1	he	doesn’t	want	to	chill	there	for	very	long 1
chilling	isn’t	exactly	in	his	vocabulary 1	which	is…
potentially	why	he’s	so	burnt	out 1	why	he	can’t	even	think
about	continuing	with	law	school 1
he	turns	back	to	ethan 1	feeling	a	fresh	streak	of	fear
run	down	his	spine 1	the	amount	of	debt	he’s	carrying
now…
what	the	fuck	is	he	doing	with	his	life 1
he	focuses	on	ethan 1	instead 3	trying	to	calm	himself 1
ethan’s	busy	rolling	a	joint	on	the	coffee	table	in	front	of
the	couch 1	damien	hasn’t	seen	his	old	friend	in	years 1	and
he	might	not	have	recognized	ethan	if	he	had	passed	him
on	the	street 1	ethan’s	once	short 1	perfectly	styled	blond
hair	has	grown	out	to	his	shoulders 1	and	it	looks	like	he
hasn’t	washed	it	in	a	few	days 1	he	seems	a	bit	taller 1	but
perhaps	with	less	muscle	definition	than	he	used	to	have 1
they	haven’t	kept	in	touch	at	all	over	the	years 1
damien	may	have	taken	a	whole	scorched	earth	approach
when	he	left	his	hometown 1	ethan’s	the	kind	of	guy	that
damien	could	always	rely	on 1	though 17	even	all	these	years
later 1	his	name	was	the	first	that	came	to	mind	when
damien	realized	he	needed	to	leave	seattle	and	all	it	took
was	a	message 1	ethan	immediately	offered	him	his	couch 1
damien	regrets	that	he	hasn’t	paid	any	attention	to
ethan’s	life 1	even	though	they	have	been	connected	on
one	of	the	popular	social	media	apps	the	entire	time 1	in
fact 1	he	doesn’t	actually	know	what	ethan	did	after	damien
left	for	college	other	than 1	apparently 3	move	out	to	portland
and	smoke	a	lot	of	weed 1

“what	do	you	do	again 1”	damien	asks	shrewdly 1	and
ethan	smiles	widely	at	him 1	his	blue	eyes	shining	with
mischief 1	you	know…”	he	waves	a	hand	with	the	freshly
rolled	joint	and	doesn’t	bother	to	finish	the	sentence 1	definitely	something	illegal 1	right 1	or	he’s	living	off
his	trust	fund 1	which	is	probably	more	likely 1
ethan’s	family	owns	some	moderately	famous	brewery
back	in	wisconsin 1	and	he	probably	doesn’t	have	to	work 1
either	way 1	damien’s	got	to	figure	out	a	better	living
situation 1	immediately 1
but	he	has…	nothing	really 1	leaving	law	school	means
being	completely	cut	off	from	whatever	life	his	parents
wanted	him	to	live 1	he	left	everything	he	owned	in	seattle 1
none	of	it	was	really	his	anyways 1	he’s	been	living
on	borrowed	time 1
his	old	roommate	keeps	calling	him	–	he	has	twelve
missed	calls	and	a	slew	of	texts	lighting	up	the	screen	of
his	phone 1	he	almost	wishes	he	had	just	left	the	damn
thing	on	the	bus	he	took	down	here 1	he	has	to	figure	out
how	to	make	it	on	his	own	now 1	she	can’t	help	him 1	she
wouldn’t	understand 1	and	anyways 2	he	left	a	note 1	so	it’s
not	like	he	just	completely	disappeared 1
he	breathes	deeply 1	trying	to	regain	some	composure 1
and	he	immediately	regrets	it 1	the	air	is	stale	with	the
smell	of	old	pot	smoke	and	something	sour 1	damien’s	sure
this	apartment	hasn’t	been	cleaned	since	ethan	moved
into	it	however	many	years	ago 1
his	throat	feels	tight	like	he’s	choking	on	the	stale	air 1
“you	don’t	look	so	good 1	man 3	you	want	to	lie	down 1”
ethan	looks	honestly	concerned	and	gets	up	off	the	couch 1
offering	damien	his	place 1
damien	nods 2	feeling	the	weight	of	the	day	pressing
down	on	him 1	he	stretches	out	on	the	couch	despite	the

queasy	feeling	in	his	stomach 1	the	spinning	in	his	head 1
he’s	a	little	too	tall	for	the	couch	to	be	comfortable 1	but
he’s	also	exhausted 1	he	immediately	falls	asleep 1
damien	wakes	much 1	much	later	to	pounding	on	the
apartment	door 1	he	groans	as	he	sits	up 1	his	neck	is	killing
him 1	and	his	head	doesn’t	feel	much	better 1	he	can	hear
the	steady	rhythm	of	loud	music	coming	from	the	walls	of
the	apartment	next	to	them 1	he’s	surprised	it	didn’t	wake
him	up	sooner 1
“coming 1	coming 1”	ethan	yells	through	the	apartment 1
as	if	the	person	on	the	other	side	of	the	door	could
possibly	hear	him	given	the	general	noise	levels	in	this
place 1	ethan	jogs	out	of	his	bedroom 1	buttoning	up	a	pair
of	too-tight	jeans 1	his	graphic	tee	is	equally	snug 1	and	his
shoulder-length	blond	hair	is	tied	in	a	low	ponytail	at	the
nape	of	his	neck 1	still	damp	from	a	recent	shower 1	he	flings
the	door	open	without	bothering	to	look	through	the
peephole	first 1
“yo 2”	another	masculine	voice	shouts 1	“you	joining	us
over	here 1’
“yeah 1	just	give	me	a	sec 1”	ethan	says	and	then	looks
back	at	damien 1	an	obvious	question	in	his	eyes 1	damien
shrugs 2	sure 1	why	not 1	he’s	feeling	a	lot	better	now	other
than	the	cramp	in	his	neck 1	and	when	in	rome…	he	pulls
off	the	hoodie	he’s	wearing 1	deciding	that	the	plain	black	v-
neck	underneath	is	fine	enough	for	whatever	they	are
doing	tonight 1
the	other	apartment	is	identical	to	ethan’s 1	except
there	are	way	too	many	bodies	crammed	into	such	a	small
space	and	probably	not	enough	oxygen	for	any	of	them 1
it’s	smoky 1	the	music	is	too	loud 1	it	smells	like	someone’s

been	bathing	in	beer 1	damien	wonders	if	the	landlord	even
cares	and	what	the	other	tenants	think	of	it 1	he’s	not
familiar	enough	with	portland	to	know	about	the
neighborhood 1	but	it	seems	a	little…	unsavory	at	best 1
ethan	grins	at	him	and	hands	him	a	drink 1	damien	is
desperately	glad	for	it 1	he	has	another	sometime	later 1	and
maybe	a	little	pot	as	well 1	just	enough	to	send	him
spinning 1
they	go	to	a	bar	after	a	while	to	get	some	food 1	and	it’s
only	a	few	blocks	from	ethan’s	apartment	building 1	ethan
opens	up	a	tab	under	his	card 1	adding	to	damien’s
suspicions	about	the	trust	fund 1	damien	feels	weird
ordering	food 1	so	he	eats	a	couple	of	handfuls	of
someone’s	fries 1	standing	around	a	table	with	ethan	and
his	friends 1	he	has	another	drink	or	two 1	he	doesn’t	pay	for
those	either 1
the	night	begins	to	blur	around	the	edges 1	someone
grabbing	his	hip 1	handing	him	another	drink 1	someone
pressing	their	body	in	a	hot	line	against	his	side 1	an	arm
around	his	waist 1	another	drink 1	one	of	ethan’s	even
sleazier	companions 1	he	thinks 9	but	he	takes	the	glass
anyways 1	vaguely	hoping	it’s	not	drugged 1	the	glass	is
cold	in	damien’s	hand 1	and	he	can	barely	taste	whatever’s
in	it	by	this	point 1
the	other	man	flashes	damien	a	smile 1	he’s	not	bad-
looking	–	messy	brown	hair 1	pretty	fit	–	but	damien	can’t
bring	himself	to	care	all	that	much 1	about	the	drink 1	about
the	guy 1	about	this	place 1	his	mood	is	spiraling
downwards 1	not	that	he	was	in	the	best	frame	of	mind	to
begin	with 1
what’s	the	point 1
ethan	is	leaving	then 1	loudly	laughing	with	a	group	of
some	of	the	others	from	the	smoky	apartment 1	and	he
motions	for	damien	to	come	with	them 1	damien	waves	him

off 1	he	can	probably	find	his	own	way	back 1	he
doesn’t	want	to	go	back	to	the	apartment	with	them 1	and
he	wouldn’t	be	surprised	if	they	get	the	cops	called	on
them	tonight 1	he	thinks	he’ll	try	to	sneak	back	to	ethan’s
place	after	a	bit	longer 1	after	he	finishes	this	last	drink 1
the	guy	next	to	him	is	getting	more	handsy 1
now	that	the	rest	of	the	group	left 1	he	tilts	his	head 1	eyes
darting	towards	the	bathrooms 1	giving	damien	an	obvious
invitation 1	damien	is	not	even	vaguely	interested 1	but	he
smiles	like	he	is 1	and	lets	the	guy	head	that	way	on	his
own 1	damien	downs	the	rest	of	the	drink	and	slips	outside
into	the	cool	night	air 1	he	has	enough	sense	not	to	accept
a	drunk	hookup	in	the	bathroom	of	a	bar	on	his	first	night
here 1
ethan’s	group	is	nowhere	to	be	seen 1	and	everything
seems	to	be	moving	in	slow	motion	now 1	the	late	night	city
sounds	are	too	quiet	after	the	noise	from	inside	the	bar 1
like	a	sudden	blanket	falling	over	him 1	he	realizes 4	in	an
offhand	way 1	that	he	is	probably	too	drunk	to	find	his	way
back	to	the	apartment 1	but	he	tries	anyway 1	it’s	only
supposed	to	be	a	couple	of	blocks 1
everything	is	still	moving	strangely	around	him 1
and	it	feels	like	the	streetlights	are	strobing 1	in	fact 7	he’s
already	walked	farther	than	he	remembered	from	earlier	in
the	evening 1
he	stops	at	a	crosswalk	and	pulls	out	his	phone	to
open	up	a	map	application 1	but	the	damn	thing	is	dead 1	he
slides	it	back	into	his	pocket 1	suddenly	feeling	sick 1	he’s
pretty	sure	he’s	lost	now 1	and	he	hasn’t	even	been	here	for
a	day 1	there’s	no	one	around	that	he’d	feel	comfortable
asking	directions	from 1	he	probably	should	have	just	let
the	guy	from	the	bar	get	off	and	then	followed	him	back	to
ethan’s	building 1	it’s	not	like	he	hasn’t	done	something	like
that	on	so	many	other	nights 1	especially	in	undergrad 1	but

maybe	never	when	he	felt	like	this 1	he	feels	disgusted	with
himself 1	his	life	is	a	mess 1	and	that	last	drink	is	catching	up
to	him	in	a	bad	way 1
the	light	at	the	crosswalk	changes 1	and	he	crosses	the
street	just	to	keep	moving 1	maybe	find	another	bar 1
somewhere	he	can	ask	directions 1
and	then	he	sees	it 1
it’s	a	door 1	in	an	alleyway 2	he’s	about	to	pass	by	it 1
generally	knowing	better	than	to	even	look	down	dark
alleyways	at	this	time	of	night 1	but	he	feels	a	sort	of	tug 1	an
odd	surge	of	curiosity 1
he	stops 1	stares	at	it 1	feels	the	world	tilt	a	bit	under	his
feet 1	it	looks	just	like	a	hotel	room	door 1
like	something	you’d	see	on	the	inside	of	a	hotel 1	he
frowns 1	but	his	feet	are	moving	in	that	direction 1	taking	him
towards	it 1	curiosity	again 1	confusion 1
maybe	he’s	dreaming 1	maybe	his	drink	was	laced	with
something	after	all 1
he	touches	the	handle 1	wondering	if	it’s	real 1	and	the
door	opens	with	the	slightest	of	pressure 1
he…	he	can’t	see	anything	on	the	other	side 1	just
vague	shapes 1	muted	colors 1	it	feels	like	he	woke	up	with
blurry	eyes 1	and	he	tries	to	rub	them 1	but	his	vision	doesn’t
clear 1	he	finds	himself	stumbling	through	the	threshold 1
almost	as	if	he	is	being	pulled	inside	by	an	unseen	force 1
the	lights	are	much 1	much	brighter	all	of	a	sudden 1	and
the	room	beyond	the	door	is	gorgeous 1	it	feels	like	he’s
walking	into	a	dream 1	or	a	fantasy 1
this	is	the	kind	of	place	damien	wishes	he	was	staying
in 1	a	luxury	hotel	suite 1	beautiful	furnishings 1	a	huge	king-
sized	bed	that	calls	to	him	with	its	siren	song 1	fluffy
pillows 1	clean 1	probably	high	thread	count	linens 1	this	is
the	kind	of	life	damien	imagined	for	himself 1	when	he
thought	about	being	a	hotshot	corporate	lawyer 1	all-

expenses	paid	trips	to	meet	with	clients 1	a	company	credit
line 1	fine	dining 1	validation 1	this	is	what	he’s	giving	up 1
he	glances	back	at	the	door 1	but	it’s	gone 1
goosebumps	crawl	up	his	arms 1	even	though	the	room	is
warm 1	something	in	the	back	of	his	mind	is	ringing	out	in
alarm 1	but	he	turns	towards	the	bed	instead 1	he’s	so	tired 1
it’s	been	such	a	long	day 1	such	a	long	bus	ride	down	here 1
such	a	long	time	pretending	he	cared	about	catching	up
with	his	friend	from	high	school 1	about	the	people	at	the
party 1	about	the	guy	at	the	bar 1	he’s	not	sure	why	any	of
this	is	here 1	maybe	he	is	drugged 1	or	maybe	he	already
passed	out	somewhere 1	or	maybe	he’s	back	at	his	friend’s
apartment 1	and	he’s	totally	lost	it 1	hallucinating	all	of	this 1
he	really 1	truly	doesn’t	care	anymore 1
he	throws	himself	onto	the	bed 1	heedless	of	his
clothes 1	barely	conscious	enough	to	kick	off	his	shoes 1
he	sleeps 1

chapter	two
damien	opens	his	eyes	to	find	an	absurdly	attractive
blond	man	glaring	down	at	him 1
“how	did	you	get	in	here 1”	the	man	asks 1	he	looks
precisely	like	an	annoyed	male	model	out	of	a	fashion
magazine 1	damien	pushes	himself	up 1	head	throbbing	and
stomach	tilting 1	he’s	in	a	hotel	room 1	he…	he
thought	there	was	a	door 1	but	no 2	that
can’t	be	right 1
“uh…”	damien	supplies	helpfully 1	the	other	man
doesn’t	seem	very	sympathetic 1	his	gaze	is	icy 1
“no	seriously 1”	the	blond	says 1	but	damien	doesn’t
actually	remember	what	happened	last	night	very	well 1	he
feels	a	small	thread	of	panic	rising	in	him 1	he	scans	his
eyes	across	the	hotel	room 1	he	really	thought	there	was
another	door	somewhere 1	but	everything’s	muddled	now 1
the	man’s	scowl	deepens 1	and	he	shakes	his	head 2
“forget	it 1”	he	says 17	waving	a	hand	as	if	to	clear	this	all
away 1	“i’m	getting	melanie 1”
melanie 1	damien	thinks 3	but	he	doesn’t	dare	to	reply 1
he	falls	back	onto	the	bed	as	soon	as	the	door	closes 1
he’s	thankful	to	be	rid	of	the	tall 1	blond	man 1	the	guy
seemed	like	an	asshole 1	maybe	he’s

dreaming 1	and	if	he	closes	his	eyes 1	he’ll	wake	up	on
ethan’s	couch 1	isn’t	that	how	this	works 1
the	door	opens	again 1	and	his	eyes	snap	open	along
with	it 1	no	such	luck 1	the	ceiling	is	exactly	the	same	as	it
was	a	few	minutes	ago 1	he	sits	up 1	too	quickly 1	this	time
his	head	is	really	spinning 1	and	he	thinks	maybe	laying
down	again	wasn’t	such	a	good	idea 1	especially	since	this
doesn’t	appear	to	be	a	dream	at	all 1	he	winces	in	pain	at
the	brightness	of	the	lights 1	but	his	eyes	catch	on	the
woman	in	the	doorway 1
she	has	long 1	dark	brown	hair	and	dark	brown	eyes 1
pale	olive	skin 1	petite 1	or	at	least	much	shorter	than	the
last	guy 1	she’s	wearing	casual 1	but	classy	clothing 1	nothing
like	a	hotel	uniform 1	she	doesn’t	look	like	hotel	staff	at	all 1	damien	was	half-expecting	the	gorgeous	blond
man	to	be	bringing	in	some	sort	of	manager	or	security
person	to	kick	him	out 1	instead…
“oh	my 1”	the	woman	says 1	and	she	sounds…
interested 1	but	not	in	the	way	that	damien	might	expect 1
what	did	that	grumpy	guy	say	her	name	was	again 1
“look	what	we’ve	found 1”	she	continues 2	and	she	walks
closer	to	the	bed 1	not	all	that	surprised	to	find	a	stranger	in
the	room 1
“where	am	i 1”	he	asks 12	because	it’s	currently	his	top
priority 1	right	behind	how	the	hell	did	i	get	here 1	but	he
hopes	maybe	the	answer	to	the	second	question	will	follow
the	first 1	his	voice	comes	out	hoarser	than	he	expects 1	and
he	clears	his	throat 1	suddenly	terribly	thirsty 1
the	woman	smiles	slowly 1	and	it’s	not	a	nice
expression	but	also	not	completely	unfriendly 1
“you’re	exactly	where	you’re	supposed	to	be 1”	she
says 3	and	her	eyes	dance	with	some	unspoken	joke 1
something	he’s	not	getting 1	damien	frowns 1
“why	don’t	you	get	cleaned	up 1	and	we	can	talk

afterwards 1”	she	suggests 1	and	damien	stares	at	her	for	a
moment 1	but	she	holds	his	gaze 1	completely	unconcerned 1
he	nods 2	what	else	is	he	supposed	to	do 1	he’s
obviously	gotten	himself	into	some	sort	of	weird	situation 1
and	he	probably	was	drugged	last	night 1	maybe	it’s	a	good
idea	to	go	take	a	shower	and	make	sure	he	has	all	of	his
internal	organs…
plus 1	being	clean	will	definitely	improve	the	situation 1
he	currently	feels…	disgusting 1	really 2	he	needs	some
water 1	badly 1	he	waits	for	her	to	leave 1	watching	her	turn	to
go 1	feeling	like	it	would	be	rude	to	stand	in	her	presence	in
his	current	state 1
she	pauses	in	the	doorway 1	glancing	back	at	him 1	and
then	she	laughs 1	a	sound	like	bells 1	“you	can	use	whatever
you	find	in	there 1”	she	says 13	pointing	to	a	doorway 1	which
damien	can	only	assume	is	the	connecting	bathroom 1	he
finds	that	he	urgently	needs	to	use	it 1	actually 1	and	his	face
heats	as	she	leaves 1
this	whole	situation	is	fucked 1	but	he’s	at
least	going	to	take	advantage	of	this	gorgeous	hotel	suite 1
the	bathroom	is	just	as	luxurious	as	the
connecting	suite 1	but	he	wouldn’t	have	expected	any	less 1
spotless 1	shining	fixtures 1	marble	countertops 1	fluffy
towels	folded	neatly	next	to	a	large	rainfall-style	shower 1	a
deep	tub	that	could	probably	accommodate	several
guests 1	he	spends	maybe	just	a	little	too	much	time	in	the
shower	using	the	tasteful 1	yet	elegant	vanilla-scented	bath
products	provided 1	the	hot	water	feels	amazing 1	and	he’s
reluctant	to	leave	it 1	he	hasn’t	actually	felt	this	clean	since
he	left	seattle 1
unfortunately	he	ends	up	having	to	put	on	his	clothes

from	last	night 1	since	there’s	nothing	else	to	wear 1	and
weirdly	enough 1	he	can’t	find	a	hair	dryer 1	what	kind	of
hotel	suite	doesn’t	have	a	hair	dryer 1	especially	in	a	place
this	fancy 1	it’s	perhaps	the	only	thing	missing 1	and	it
strikes	him	as	odd 1	maybe	the	last	guest	swiped	it 1	and	the
staff	just	forgot	to	replace	it 1
after	a	few	more	moments	of	searching 1	he	starts	to
feel	bad	for	taking	such	a	long	time	when	that	strange
woman	is	probably	waiting	for	him 1	not	that	he	necessarily
wants	to	talk	to	her	again 1	but	it	would	be	nice	to	figure	out
where	the	heck	he	ended	up	last	night 1
he	grabs	a	towel 1	rubbing	it	over	his	head	and
pouting	a	bit	in	the	mirror 1	he	doesn’t	have	any	of	his	usual
styling	products 1	so	his	sandy	brown	hair	is	going	to	dry
weirdly 1	the	hair	dryer	would	have	been	the	only	possible
way	of	saving	it 1	such	is	his	luck	today 1
damien	is	still	toweling	off	his	hair	and	isn’t	paying
much	attention	as	he	steps	back	into	the	room 1	he	nearly
jumps	out	of	his	skin	at	the	sight	of	yet	another	man	sitting
cross-legged	on	the	bed 1	damien	lowers	the	towel
cautiously 1	this	man	is	also	on	the	petite	side	with	messy
brown	hair 1	he	looks	a	whole	lot	friendlier	than	the	blond
guy	from	earlier 1	he’s	grinning	widely	at	damien 1
“hi 2”	he	says	cheerfully 1	and	his	bright	blue	eyes	seem
genuinely	happy	to	see	damien 1	“melanie	told	me	to	bring
you	to	her	when	you’re	ready 1”
damien	tilts	his	head 1	“melanie 1	thinking
maybe	that’s	the	name	he	heard	earlier 1	his	head’s
clearing	a	bit	after	the	shower 1	but	he	still	feels	a	little	like
he’s	walking	through	a	dream 1	who	could	blame	him 1
given	the	circumstances 1
the	man	looks	confused	for	a	moment 1	but	eventually
nods 1	“i	see 1	“she’s	like	that	sometimes 1”	and 1	he	sounds	completely	genuine	and	even	apologetic 1

“the	woman	you	met	earlier 1”	he	explains 1	“she’s	melanie
selinofoto 1	the	lady	of	the	house 1	and	the	owner	of	this
place 1”	he	gestures	to	the	room	around	them 1
damien	has	a	lot	of	questions	as	to	why	the	owner	of	a
hotel	would	personally	come	to	greet	him 1	but	before	he
can	ask	further 1	the	man	stands	up	and	extends	a	hand 1
“and	i’m	liam	o’connell 1
damien	shakes	liam’s	hand 1	attempting	to	return	his
smile 1	at	least	he’s	getting	a	proper	introduction	finally 1
“damien 3”	he	replies 1	realizing	no	one’s	asked	him	his
name	since	he’s	been	here 1
liam	smiles 1	not	even	pressing	for	his	last	name	or	any
identification 1	“nice	to	meet	you 1	damien 5”
liam	hooks	a	thumb	towards	the	door	melanie	left
through	earlier 1	“you	ready 1	and	damien	glances
remorsefully	at	the	towel	in	his	hand	and	then	nods 1	might
as	well	get	this	over	with 1	he	has	to	admit	he’s	feeling
rather	uncertain	about	the	whole	situation 1	but	there’s	no
use	hiding	in	this	hotel	room	all	day 1
liam	laughs 1	gesturing	to	the	towel	and	then	to
damien’s	hair 1	“sorry	about	that 2	we	don’t	usually	keep
hair	dryers	in	here 1”	he	shrugs 1	as	if	it’s	not	a	big	deal 1
damien	glances	at	the	other	man’s	clothes 1	again 2	casual
attire 1	nothing	like	any	hotel	uniform	he	has	ever	seen 1
he	wonders	what	liam	does	here	exactly 1	but	liam	is
already	opening	the	door	to	the	hallway 1	gesturing	for
damien	to	follow 1	damien	throws	the	towel	onto	the	bed 1
feeling	a	little	lost 1
the	feeling	only	intensifies	when	they	step	out	into	a
hallway	that	looks	more	like	the	inside	of	an	apartment
complex	than	the	luxury	hotel	he	expected 1	damien	looks
back	at	the	room	they’d	been	in	and	a	sudden	shock	runs
through	him 1	no	windows 1
“this	isn’t	a	hotel 1	almost	as	if	to	himself 1	and

liam	shakes	his	head 1	laughing	softly 1	melanie	will	explain	things 1”	he	says	and	leads
damien	down	the	hallway	to	some	sort	of	shared	living
space 1
on	one	side	of	the	space 1	there	is	a	full	kitchen	with	all
of	the	latest	appliances 1	like	something	out	of	a	home	and
garden	magazine 1	on	the	other	end 1	there	are	couches 1	a
huge	television 1	and	another	hallway	leading	the	opposite
direction 1	liam	leads	him	to	a	side	door	that	opens	into	an
elevator	room 1	damien	feels	his	throat	constrict	with	fear 1
but	he’s	gone	too	far	now 1	he	pats	his	pockets 1	realizing
his	phone’s	still	on	him	and	his	wallet 1	although 1	damnit 1
his	phone	died	last	night 1	if	he	remembers	right 1	and	he
definitely	didn’t	charge	it 1	he	glances	over	at	liam 1	feeling
nervous 1	liam	seems	oblivious	to	his	concern 1	does	this
sort	of	thing	happen	regularly	here 1
they	get	into	the	elevator 1	and	there	are	only	three
buttons 1	liam	presses	the	button	for	the	third	floor	and
shrugs 1	“we	could	have	used	the	stairs 1	but	thought	you
might	still	be	a	little	unsteady	on	your	feet 1
damien	appreciates	that	at	least 1	he’s	not	feeling	the
hottest	still 1	and	he	doesn’t	actually	know	what	time	it	is
since	his	phone	is	dead	and	there	hadn’t	been	any	clocks
in	the	hotel	suite 1
the	elevator	opens	up	to	another	set	of	doors 1	and
liam	waves	a	card	at	the	little	black	keycard	scanner	on
the	side	that	beeps 1	the	doors	click	audibly	as	they	unlock 1
and	liam	opens	one 1	gesturing	for	damien	to	go	ahead 1
the	third	floor	is	completely	different	from	the	second 1
it	looks	more	like	a	traditional	apartment	building 1	with
rows	of	doors	on	either	side	of	a	hallway 1	liam	leads
damien	down	to	a	door	at	the	very	end 1	he	swipes	his
keycard	again 1	and	opens	the	door	to	an	office 1	tall

bookshelves	filled	to	the	very	top	bracketing	either	side 1
and	finally	windows 1	floor-to-ceiling 1	a	cautious	glance
outside	tells	him	that	it	still	looks	like	they	are	in	portland 1
not	that	he’d	really	thought	otherwise 1	probably 1
the	woman	from	earlier	is	sitting	in	a	chair 1	smiling	at
him	in	that	odd	way	of	hers 1
“what	is	this	place 1”	damien	asks 2	and	melanie	waves
a	hand	at	liam 1	obviously	dismissing	him 1	liam	gives
damien	a	comforting	grin	and	closes	the	door	behind	him 1
damien	doesn’t	feel	comforted	at	all 1
“what’s	your	name 1”	melanie	asks	after	liam	leaves 1
completely	ignoring	damien’s	own	question 1	damien’s
fairly	annoyed	at	that 1	but	he’s	also	surprised	that	she
doesn’t	already	know	somehow 1”	he	answers 1	and	she	continues	to	watch	him
expectantly 1
“damien	lambert 1”	he	clarifies 1	suddenly	feeling	like
he’d	tell	her	anything	just	to	get	her	to	stop	looking	at	him
like	that 1
“ah 4	welcome 2”	she	says	in	reply 1	and	the
temperature	in	the	room	almost	seems	to	warm	a	bit	at	her
welcome 1	she	glances	at	him	carefully	now 1	but	less
challenging	than	earlier 1	he	waits 1	not	sure	what	else	she’s
expecting	from	him 1	but	she	simply	gestures	for	him	to	sit
down	in	a	chair	in	front	of	her	desk 1	pulling	the	chair	out 1
“you	found	your	way	here	through	a	door 1”	she	asks
as	he	sits	down 1	and	he	notices	that	she’s	putting	an	odd
emphasis	on	the	word	door 1
he	tries	thinking	back	to	what	actually	happened	last
night 1	but	his	head	feels	like	it	might	split	open 1	trying	to
remember 1	he	shrugs 1	“i	sort	of	remember	that 1
and	melanie	grins	at	him 1
“i	made	it 1	simply 2	and	damien’s	not	sure	at

first	if	she	means	the	entire	hotel	or	what 1	but	she
continues 1	“it	brings	me	things 1	interesting	things 1	like	you 1”
she	taps	her	fingers	together 1	looking	at	him	with	a	curious
expression 1	and	damien	seriously	has	no	idea	what	this
woman	is	talking	about 1	but	his	head	hurts	too	much	to
bother	asking	about	the	specifics 1
he	must	pass	some	sort	of	obscure	test 1	because	she
continues	explaining	anyways 1
“i	run	a	very	specific	type	of	business	here 1
her	dark	eyes	watching	him	closely 1	and	the	realization
washes	over	damien	like	ice	water 1	oh	shit 1	it’s	one	of
those	types	of	places 1
“liam	and	sebastian	are	hosts 1	and
damien	can	only	assume	sebastian	is	the	grumpy	blond
from	earlier 1
“they	found	their	way	to	me	through	various	means 1
just	as	you	did 1”	melanie	says 2	“and	they	work	with	clients
at	this	establishment 1”
damien	feels	a	shiver	of	fear	as	his	worst	assumptions
are	flat-out	confirmed 1	he	makes	a	move 1	as	if	he’s	going
to	stand 1	suddenly	realizing	he’s	probably	locked	in	here
and	doesn’t	know	how	he’d	get	out	anyways 1	and	his
phone	is	still	dead	on	top	of	that 1
melanie	holds	up	her	hand 1	laughing 1	“don’t	flee	yet 1”
she	says 2	“you	have	every	choice	as	to	whether	or	not	you
want	to	accept	my	offer 1	you’re	not	a	captive	here 1”	her
words	echo	his	thoughts	almost	too	perfectly 1	and	his	fear
abates	only	slightly 1	she	smiles	that	odd	smile	of	hers
again 1	“and	there	will	be	an	offer…”
an…	offer 1	like…	a	job	offer 1	he	considers	the	idea
for	a	moment 1	she	mentioned	hosting 1	he	has	a	pretty
clear	picture	of	what	that	might	entail 1	he’s	fit 1	he	knows
he’s	attractive 1	more	importantly 1	he’s	hundreds	of
thousands	of	dollars	in	debt…	the	thought	of	the	exact

number	chokes	him 1	he	has	no	idea	how	he’ll	pay	it	back 1
he	hasn’t	even	considered	how	he’ll	find	a	job 1	he	just
got	here	yesterday 1
he	meets	her	gaze	and	feels	a	little	bit	like	he’s	in	one
of	those	old	tales	where	someone	is	offering	him	the	world 1
if	only	he’ll	trade	his	soul…
melanie	must	take	his	silence	as	a	signal	to	continue 1
“sometimes	the	client	doesn’t	even	know	what	they	want 1
but	deep	in	their	heart	there	is	a	yearning	for	something 1	her	eyes	gleam	in	a	slightly	unsettling	way 1
reinforcing	the	unfortunate	comparison	of	a	deal	with	the
devil 1	“the	door	provides	an	opportunity	for	them 1	it’s	not
necessarily	about	sex 1	outright	admitting	what
he	had	assumed 1	“but	humans	being	what	they	are 1	it’s
often	about	sex 1”
damien	notices 1	quite	pointedly 1	that	she	does	not
appear	to	include	herself	in	that	group 1	humans 1
perhaps	the	deal	with	the	devil	analogy	is	not	so	far
off…	he	clears	his	throat 1
“what	do	you	get	out	of	this 1	almost	afraid	to
hear	the	answer 1
“plenty	of	things 1”	she	replies	easily 1	“of	course	there	is
usually	financial	compensation 1	some	of	our	clients	are
quite	wealthy 1”
but	damien	can’t	help	but	notice	her	unspecifics	again 1
he’s	not	sure	if	he	really	wants	to	ask	further	questions…
what	else	could	she	be	getting	out	of	it 1	is	she	really
collecting	souls 1	he’s	heard	stories	about	the	paranormal
community 1	but	mostly	that 1	just	stories 1	he’s	never
personally	interacted	with	anyone	who	belonged	to	it 1	and
some	people	didn’t	even	believe	that	it	existed 1	some	sort
of	conspiracy	theory 1	or	maybe	just	a	bunch	of	eccentrics 1
he	shivers 1	sitting	here 1	in	this	office	with	melanie
selinofoto 1	he	suddenly	believes	all	of	the	terrible	stories

he’s	ever	heard 1
but	he’s	also	curious 1	perhaps	more	curious	than
scared 1
isn’t	this	what	he	came	to	portland	for 1	change 1
what	would	be	more	of	a	change	than	this 1
“i’m	interested 1”	he	forces	himself	to	say 1	even	if	he’s
still	unsure 1	she	must	see	it	in	his	face 1	he	probably	looks
terrified 1	he	feels	terrified 1
“what’s	involved 1	waiting	for	the	other	pin	to
drop 1
she	laughs	again 1	and	her	smile	is	a	little	friendlier	now 1
it	seems	like	she’s	warming	up	a	bit	with	each	interaction 1	i’ll	give	you	an	offer 1	and	we’ll	sign	a	contract 1	“but	i	want	you	to	think	it	over	first 1”
he	nods 1	that	sounds	reasonable	enough 1
the	offer 1	however 2	is	ridiculous 1	all-expenses	paid	to
live	in	this	building 1	all	food	and	clothing	provided	plus
90%	of	any	money	the	clients	offered 1	if	money	was	part	of
the	contract 1	“if	it’s	not 1	we’ll	negotiate	a	fair	price 1	completely	unconcerned	with	how	insane	all	of	this
sounds 1	damien	asks	about	the	typical	rates	for	a	client 1
and	she	smiles	mysteriously	at	him 1
“it	depends	on	the	client 1	and	her	smile	is
sharp 1	“they	name	their	own	price 1”
yep 1	insane	and	creepy 1	she	gives	him	an	example	of	a
recent	contract 1
“you’ve	got	to	be	kidding 1	“that	much 1”
she	inclines	her	head	in	agreement 1	“the	door
provides	exactly	what	the	client	desires 1	most	of	them	will
give	anything	to	have	access	to	their	host	again…”
damien’s	a	little	glad	he’s	going	to	be	the	host	in	this
scenario 1	it	sounds	like	the	clients	are	the	ones	truly
trading	their	souls 1
“alright 3”	he	finds	himself	saying 1	“i’ll	do	it 1	where	do	i

sign 1”
she	laughs	outright	at	this 1	looking	far	too	amused 1	my 1	“i	didn’t	think	you’d	be	so	easy	to
convince 1”
his	face	heats	at	that 1	but	this	is	the	kind	of	offer	you
don’t	turn	down 1	a	small	part	of	him	still	wonders	if	there’s
a	catch	somewhere 1	but	he’s	in	such	a	desperate
situation…
she	shakes	her	head	at	him	though 1	“you’ve	had	a	long
day 1	and	he	wonders	how	much	she	knows
about	his	day 1	exactly 1	but	pushes	the	thought	away 1	she
can’t	possibly	be	able	to	read	thoughts 1
“go	home	and	think	it	over 1	“let	me	know	by
the	end	of	the	week 1	you’re	welcome	to	chat	more	with
liam 1	as	well 2”
damien	doesn’t	have	a	home	to	go	back	to 1	and	at	this
point	he	doesn’t	even	know	what	day	of	the	week	it	is 1	but
he	nods 1	completely	intending	to	come	back	here	as	soon
as	he	can	go	pick	up	his	stuff	from	ethan’s	place 1	he
doesn’t	even	need	to	talk	to	liam	or	the	grumpy	blond 1
offer	accepted 1	let’s	do	this	thing 1	and	even	his
headache	is	fading	now 1	everything	feels	crystal	clear 1	and
he	sees	this	path	set	out	before	him 1	it’s	nothing	worse
than	what	he’s	done	in	bars	and	clubs	all	throughout
college 1	fucking	strangers 1	but	now	he’ll	be	doing	it	in	a
luxury	hotel	and	getting	paid	for	it 1	and	paying	off	his
loans 1	sign	me	up 1
melanie	lets	him	leave	not	too	long	after	their
conversation	about	the	contract 1	damien	ends	up	talking	to
liam	again	briefly	while	he	waits	for	a	rideshare	to	show
up 1	liam	gives	him	a	quick	tour	of	the	shared	living	space

on	the	second	floor	and	shows	him	the	café	on	the	first
floor 1
“melanie	likes	us	to	work	in	the	café 1	too 1”	liam
explains 1	“it	helps	keep	up	the	image 1”	he	has	the	decency
to	blush 1
damien	wonders	how	someone	like	liam	got	involved
in	all	of	this 1	the	grumpy	blond	–	sebastian	–	definitely
seems	more	like	the	type	to	do	this	sort	of	thing 1	more	like
damien 1	precisely 1	liam	seems	far	too	innocent	to	be
involved	in	this	sort	of	trade 1	maybe	he’ll	ask	later 1	of	course 2	he’s	planning	on	coming	back	tonight 1
he’s	not	spending	a	single	night	on	ethan’s	dirty	couch
if	he	can	help	it 1	disregarding	the	nap	he	took	yesterday 1	of
course 1
the	rideshare	pulls	up	in	front	of	the	café 1	and	liam
waves	goodbye	to	him 1	damien	looks	back	to	see	the	sign
on	the	front	of	the	building 1	café	seuil 2	what	a	bizarre
name 1	but	he	hops	in	the	rideshare	car 1	making
a	note	to	ask	about	that	as	well 1
ethan’s	apartment	building	turns	out	to	be	not	too	far
away	from	the	café 1	but	far	enough	that	damien	couldn’t
have	possibly	walked	all	the	way	there	last	night 1	damien
presses	the	buzzer	to	ethan’s	apartment 1	thankful	the
other	man	is	there 1	ethan	had	never	given	him	a	key	or
anything	like	that 1	and	it	looks	like	the	building	uses	the
same	sort	of	keycard	system	that	café	seuil	does 1	so
damien	doubts	he	would	have	been	able	to	get	into	the
building	regardless 1”	ethan	says 3	sounding	happy	to	see	him 1
voice	tinny	through	the	speaker 1	“come	on	up 1”
damien	rolls	his	eyes	at	ethan’s	enthusiasm 1	but	pulls
the	door	open	as	soon	as	he	hears	the	click	of	the	lock
moving 1	ethan’s	building	seems	old	and	run-down 1
especially	compared	to	the	hotel	suite	in	the	café 1	an	odd

place	for	a	trust	fund	baby	to	live 1	but	who	is	damien	to
judge 1”	ethan	greets	him	with	a	sly	grin	at	the	door 1
slapping	him	on	the	back 1	“you	get	some	last	night 1”
damien	frowns 1	shaking	his	head 2	“you	weren’t 1	oh	i
don’t	know…	concerned	about	me	or	anything 1	but	he	looks	a	little	unsure	now 1	like
maybe	he	thinks	he	should	have	been	concerned 1	he
scratches	the	back	of	his	head 1	“i	mean 1	i	saw	you	hitting
up	jeremy 1	thought	you	guys	spent	the	night	together 1”	he
frowns 1	looking	honestly	worried	and	throws	himself	down
onto	the	couch 1	grabbing	a	lighter	from	the	coffee	table
and	flicking	the	starter	out	of	habit 1	dude 1
you	okay 1”
“it’s	fine 1”	damien	says 7	even	though	the	whole
situation	is	seriously	not	fine 1	he’s	starting	to	feel	a	little
nervous 1	especially	with	some	time	and	space
away	from	the	café 1	he	pushes	forward 1	he	can	do
this 1	what	other	choice	does	he	have 1
damien	didn’t	bring	much	with	him	when	he	left	seattle 1
and	he	hasn’t	even	unpacked	anything 1	he	spots	his	bags
on	the	floor	next	to	the	couch 1	still	in	the	same	location	as
they	were	yesterday 1	he	feels	ethan’s	eyes	tracking	him
the	whole	time	as	he	walks	over	to	grab	them 1
ethan	immediately	stands	back	up 1	“woah 1	you	going
somewhere 1”	he’s	understandably	completely	confused 1
damien	sighs 1	not	wanting	to	explain	the	whole	thing 1	“i
found	a	job 1	another	place	to	stay 1	even	though	it
sounds	totally	unbelievable 1	he	almost	expects	ethan	to
question	him	about	it 1	but	ethan	just	grins 1	obviously
relieved 1
“aw 4	that’s	great 1	“you	really	got	me
worried	there 1”	he	chuckles	to	himself 1	“well 4	you	can
always	crash	here 1	if	you	need	it 1”

ethan	seems	so	earnest	that	damien	realizes	he’s
being	sort	of	an	asshole	about	this	whole	thing 1	this	guy
did	just	offer	him	a	place	to	stay 1	no	strings	attached 1	with
no	set	end	date 1	after	not	having	seen	damien	for	so	many
years 1	and	damien	probably	did	seem	like	he	was	going	to
go	home	with…	jeremy 1	or	whoever	the	sleazy	guy	at	the
bar	was	last	night 1	thanks 1	and	he	really	means	it	this
time 1
ethan	rolls	the	lighter	in	his	hand	in	a	practiced	move
and	then	slides	it	into	his	pocket 1	he	holds	out	his	hand 1
“see	you	around 2”
damien	honestly	doesn’t	think	he	will 1	but	he	shrugs
and	takes	the	other	man’s	hand 1	anyways 2	shaking	it 1	“see
you	around 1”	he	agrees 1	and	then	he	heads	through	the
dingy	apartment	building	back	down	to	street	level 1
hopping	back	into	the	rideshare	that	he	requested	to	wait
for	him 1
he	hopes	that	he’s	not	making	the	second	biggest
mistake	of	his	life 1

chapter	three
it’s	completely	dark	by	the	time	damien	makes	it
back	to	the	café 1	bags	in	hand 1	the	café	is	in	a	trendy-
looking	part	of	southeast	portland	on	a	corner	lot 1	other
cafés	and	restaurants	line	the	busy	street	with	some	newer
apartment	buildings	scattered	in	between 1
damien	looks	up	at	the	sign	again 1	the
café	itself	looks	closed 1	all	of	the	windows	in	the	front	of
the	building	have	shades	pulled	down	over	them 1	the	café
must	have	been	closed	all	day	today 1	now	that	he	thinks
about	it 1	because	there	had	been	no	patrons	when	he	left
earlier 1	liam	had	taken	damien	through	the	main	café
seating	area	with	the	front	entrance 1	showing	him	where
he	might	work	if	he	accepted	the	offer 1	and	damien	had	left
through	the	front	of	the	building 1
damien	is	sure	there’s	got	to	be	a	side	door 1
especially	with	the	residences	above	it 1	he	finds	himself
going	into	a	dark	alley	for	the	second	time	in	less	than
twenty-four	hours 1	and	he	feels	a	weird	sense	of	deja	vu 1
did	that	really	happen 1
he	shakes	his	head 1	as	if	that	will	clear	it 1	unfog	his
memories 1	but	he	still	can’t	quite	remember 1	he	could
swear	that	he	did	walk	through	a	door	in	an	alleyway	and

end	up	in	café	seuil 1	but	the	logistics	of	it	don’t	make
sense 1	there’s	no	way	that	bar	they	went	to	was	near	the
café 1	it	would	have	been	a	much 1	much	further	walk 1	and 1	he	had	somehow	ended	up	on	the	second	floor 1
he	frowns 1	looking	at	the	side	of	the	building 1	almost
expecting	to	see	the	unusual	hotel	room	door	from	his
fuzzy	memories	of	the	previous	night 1	he	feels	disappointed 1	surely	there’s	a
residential	entrance	somewhere 1
damien	mentally	rolls	his	eyes	at	himself 1	why	would
the	residential	entrance	be	in	an	alley 1	the	café	is	on	a
corner	lot 1	so	ideally	it	would	be	accessible	to	residents
from	the	side	street 1	damien	walks	around	to	the	well-lit
side	of	the	café 1	just	as	he	suspected 1	there	is	a	small
residential	entrance	towards	the	back	of	the	building 1	he
presses	the	buzzer 1	hopeful 1”	a	flat	voice	answers 1	sounding	bored 1	“is	liam	there 1”
the	person	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	snorts 1	“of
course 1	sure	i’ll	get	him	for	you 1”
liam’s	voice	comes	out	of	the	tinny	speaker	almost
immediately 1	“hello 1”
“liam 1	feeling	oddly	thankful	to	hear	the
cheery	brunette	again 1	“it’s	damien 1”	he	hopes	he	doesn’t
have	to	explain	himself 1	you’re	back 1”	liam	says 5	and	the	lock	on	the	door
immediately	clicks	open 1	come	on	up 1”
damien	feels	an	immediate	sense	of	relief 1	they
haven’t	turned	him	away 1	so	far 1	so	good 1
this	entrance	leads	directly	into	a	familiar	room	in	the
back	of	the	building	with	the	elevator	and	several	other
doors 1	liam	had	taken	him	through	this	space	earlier	when
he	showed	damien	the	café 1	one	of	the	doors	leads	to	a
hallway	that	connects	to	the	café’s	kitchen 1	melanie’s	first

floor	office 1	and	the	main	café 1	another	door	leads	into	a
spacious	lounge	area 1	he	imagines	the	last	door	must	be
some	sort	of	maintenance	closet 1
he	waits	at	the	elevator 1	unsure	what	else	to	do 1	and
it’s	only	a	minute	or	two	later	that	the	doors	slide	open 1
liam	waves	at	him 1	come	on 1”	he	grins 1	“you
decide	already 1”
damien	nods 4	feeling	a	little	unsure 1	but	liam’s	already
grabbing	one	of	his	bags	and	pulling	it	into	the	elevator 1
liam’s	smile	is	contagious	so	damien	hazards	one	of	his
own 1
“the	beds	here	are	much	nicer	than	where	i	was
staying 1
liam	laughs	at	that	and	nods	in	agreement 1	“we	have
the	best	beds 1”	liam’s	grin	turns	a	little	mischievous 1
“are	you	sure	it’s	okay	if…”	damien	asks 1	thinking	of
melanie	and	her	contract 1	he	hasn’t	signed	anything	yet 1
liam	shrugs 1	“we’ll	get	you	squared	away	with	melanie
tomorrow 1	“it’s	fine 1”
when	they	make	it	up	to	the	second	floor 1	liam	waves
his	keycard	at	the	scanner	on	the	door	to	the	shared	living
space 1	damien	sees	the	tall	blond	from	earlier	on	a	couch 1
eyes	glued	to	a	tv	screen	where	he’s	playing	some	sort	of
popular	first-person	shooter	game 1	the	blond’s	eyes	dart
towards	damien	and	then	immediately	back	to	the	screen 1
almost	too	fast	for	damien	to	catch 1
the	man	makes	a	noise	with	his	mouth	that	sounds
less	than	impressed 1	“you 1	“so	you	took	the
offer 1	even	though	he’s	not	sure	the	other	man
can	see	him 1
liam	grabs	damien’s	other	bag	straight	out	of	his	hand
and	laughs 1	“be	nice 1”	and	it’s	obviously	directed	at	the
blond 1	who	rolls	his	eyes 1

“that’s	sebastian 1	heading	towards	the
other	side	of	the	living	space 1	“but	you	met	him	earlier 1”
damien	nods	and	follows	liam 1	they	head	down	the
other	hallway	–	not	the	one	that	would	lead	to	the	hotel
room	he	woke	up	in	this	morning 1	but	the	one	he	noticed
earlier	in	the	day 1	the	hall	is	lined	with	more	apartment-
style	doors 1	similar	to	the	third	floor	of	the	building 1	pick	one 1	“sebastian	and	i	have
these 1”	he	points	to	two	doors	that	face	each	other	further
down	the	hall 1	“we’re	the	only	ones	living	here	right	now 1”
he	adds 1	and	damien’s	a	little	surprised	about	that 1	what
kind	of	hosting	business	only	has	two	hosts 1
liam	must	see	the	look	on	damien’s	face 1	because	he
shrugs 1	opening	a	door	and	showing	damien	into	a	room 1	you	want	to	just	take	this	one 1	and
damien	pulls	his	eyes	away	from	the	other	man	to	look
into	the	room 1	it	looks	a	little	like	a	dorm	room 1
although	he	sees	a	door	that	hopefully	leads	to	a	private
bathroom 1
“not	as	fancy	as	the	suite 1”	liam	admits 1	“but	those	are
for	entertaining	clients 1”
“and	these	have	windows 1	finding	his
voice 1
liam	laughs	at	that 1	“i	guess	melanie	didn’t	want	the
hosting	rooms	to	have	those 1	“this	is	perfect 1”	he	truly	means	it 1
something	about	the	setting	makes	him	feel	immediately
more	comfortable 1	it	reminds	him	of	school 1	at
least	before	he	moved	out	to	the	apartment	with	his
roommate 1	he	frowns 1	not	wanting	to	think	about	that 1	his
phone	feels	heavy	in	his	pocket	all	of	a	sudden 1	he	never
charged	it 1	he	knows	she’s	probably	left	a	dozen	more
messages	by	now 1	and	he	should	probably	answer	them 1
liam	seems	to	easily	pick	up	on	damien’s	shift	in

moods 1	and	he	sets	the	bags	down	by	the	bed 1	there’s	a
plain	navy	blue	comforter	and	a	few	pillows	on	it 1	the	room
also	has	a	small	nightstand 1	a	desk 1	and	a	closet 1	but
nothing	else 1	don’t	let	me	keep	you 1	if	you’re	tired 1	but	you’re
welcome	to	join	us 1	with	a	gesture	back	to	the
shared	living	space 1	but	then	immediately	shakes	his	head
afterwards 1	“i	think	i’m	going	to	get	settled	in 1”	he	admits 2
liam	inclines	his	head 1	obviously	understanding 1	“sure
thing 1	smiling	a	little	softer	now 1	“let	me	know	if
you	need	anything 1	i’m	really	glad	you	decided	to	join 1”
damien	wonders	why 1	but	then	he	realizes	liam	must
get	lonely	if	all	he	has	for	company	is	sebastian 1	he
manages	a	smile	at	the	thought 1	letting	liam	close	the
door	behind	him 1	he	finds	himself	staring	around	the	room
at	the	featureless	walls 1
well 2	here	goes	nothing 1
in	the	morning 1	he	wakes	up	to	the	smell	of	coffee 1
he	grabs	his	phone	off	the	small	nightstand	to	see	the
time 1	and	instead	sees	15	missed	calls	and	a	string	of	text
messages 1
the	preview	of	one	that’s	showing	up	on	the	notification
screen	says 1	just	tell	me	you’re	alive 1
damien	immediately	feels	a	punch	of	guilt 1	right
through	his	stomach 1	along	with	sharp	hunger	pangs 1	he
hadn’t	eaten	much	of	anything	yesterday 1	just
some	crap	at	the	bar 1	his	stomach	wasn’t	really	up	to	it	on
the	ride	down…	he	clears	the	notifications	off	of	the	phone
screen	and	decides	to	take	pity	on	his	roommate 1	alive 1	he
starts	typing 1	but	immediately	deletes	it	and	throws	the

phone	back	on	the	nightstand 1	he…	he	just	can’t	deal	with
this	yet 1	he	can’t	talk	to	her	about	this 1	she	won’t
understand 1
it’s	only	5	am 1	he	wonders	if	anyone	will	be	up 1	but	the
smell	of	coffee	seems	to	indicate	that	someone	is	awake 1
he	runs	a	hand	through	his	hair 1	he’s	never	had	a	chance
to	fix	it	from	yesterday 1	it’ll	have	to	do	for	now 1	he	thinks
morosely 1	and	pulls	on	a	pair	of	sweatpants	and	a	t-shirt
before	heading	out	into	the	shared	living	space 1
sebastian’s	sitting	at	the	little	kitchen	island 1	a	cup	of
coffee	in	his	hand 1	scrolling	through	something	on	his
phone 1	he	glances	up	when	he	sees	damien 1
“melanie	will	want	to	see	you 1”	sebastian	says	in	lieu	of
a	greeting 1	and	damien	supposes	that	makes	sense 1
damien	did	just	sort	of	show	up	on	her	doorstep 1	twice 1
“can	i 1	gesturing	to	the	coffee 1	sebastian
shrugs 1	and	it	seems	like	assent 1	so	damien	grabs	a	cup 1
his	stomach	growls	loudly 1	and	his	face	heats	in
embarrassment 1	but	sebastian	doesn’t	even	look	up	from
his	phone 1
“anything	in	the	fridge	that	isn’t	labeled	is	up	for	grabs 1”
sebastian	says 2	damien	nods 1	immediately	thankful 1
he	opens	the	fridge	to	find	it	completely	stocked 1	the
opposite	of	ethan’s 1	all-expenses	paid 1	melanie
really	meant	it 1	wondering 1	he	grabs	a	carton	of
eggs	and	some	butter 1	along	with	a	box	of	pre-washed
spinach 1	he	finds	some	bread	in	a	cabinet 1	might	as	well
go	easy	on	his	stomach 1
“do	you	get	up	this	early	every	morning 1”	damien	asks
as	he	starts	making	eggs 1
sebastian	glances	up	at	him	and	shrugs 1	“pretty	much 1”
he	says 1	so… 1	not	very	talkative 1	gotcha 1	damien	wishes
liam	was	awake 1
sebastian	eventually	drains	the	rest	of	his	coffee	and

slides	off	the	stool	he’s	sitting	in 1	he	rinses	the	mug	out	in
the	sink 1	putting	it	directly	into	the	top	rack	of	the
dishwasher 1
“come	down	to	the	first	floor	when	you’re	ready 1
when	damien	shows	up	at	melanie’s	first	floor	office
later	that	morning 1	melanie	seems	less	surprised	than	she
should	have	been 1	this	office	is	much	less	flashy	than	her
third	floor	office	and	more	cluttered 1	besides 1	there	are
papers	stacked	on	top	of	each	other 1	covering	nearly	every
visible	surface	and	even	some	on	a	pile	next	to	the	floor 1	a
few	of	the	stacks	of	papers	on	her	desk	have	empty	coffee
cups	balanced	on	them 1	damien	hands	her	a	fresh	cup	of
coffee	as	a	sort	of	peace	offering 1	and	she	gives	him	a
small	half-smile	in	appreciation 1	setting	the	cup	down	on	yet	another
pile 1	damien	winces	in	fear	of	the	inevitable	spill 1	“i	guess
there’s	no	making	you	wait	until	the	end	of	the	week 1”	she
asks 1	and	damien	shakes	his	head 1
“i	don’t	really	have	anywhere	else	to	go 1
which	is	only	half	true 1	she	gives	him	a	considering	look 1
and	then	nods 1	why	don’t	you	try	a
day	working	in	the	café	with	liam	and	see	what	you	think 1
if	you	still	want	to	stay 1	we’ll	take	care	of	the	contract	later
tonight 1”
that	seems	reasonable	enough 1	so	damien	nods 1
melanie	waves	a	hand	at	him 1	dismissing	him 1	but	before
he	leaves	he	reaches	out	towards	one	of	the	empty	coffee
cups 1
she	watches	his	hand	carefully 1	and	damien	feels	a

little	bit	like	a	mouse	being	watched	by	a	curious	predator 1	can	i	take	this 1	and	she	nods 1	looking
oddly	pleased 1
damien	decides	not	to	worry	about	it	too	much	and
grabs	as	many	of	the	empty	cups	as	he	can	reasonably
carry	before	he	heads	back	into	the	hall 1
the	café’s	kitchen	is	right	next	to	melanie’s	first	floor
office 1	and	the	café	itself	is	just	down	the	hall	from	that 1
damien	stops	off	in	the	kitchen	to	put	the	mugs	in	one	of
the	big	industrial	sinks 1	sebastian	has	headphones	in	and
is	working	on	some	dough 1	he	slides	a	glance	over
towards	damien	and	then	back	to	his	dough 1	obviously
uninterested	in	damien’s	presence	in	the	kitchen 1
damien	figures	he’s	not	going	to	get	much	out	of
sebastian 1	so	he	might	as	well	make	himself	useful 1	he
finds	an	apron	in	a	supply	closet	and	then	washes	his
hands 1	whatever	they	want	him	to	do	here 1	he’ll	do	it 1	he
decides 1	this	is	the	chance	he	wanted 1	this	is	the	chance
he	needs 1	he’ll	figure	out	everything	else	as	he	goes 1

chapter	four
melanie	does	not	take	care	of	the	contract	later
that	night 1	she	makes	damien	wait	two	months	before
signing	the	damn	thing 1	to	be	more	precise 1	she
avoids	damien	for	two	months	until	he	finally	demands	for
her	to	let	him	sign	his	contract 1	who	knew	this	would	be	so
difficult 1
that	first	evening	after	he	finishes	working	in	the	café
with	liam 1	damien	looks	for	melanie	in	the	office	next	to
the	café	kitchen	and	also	the	one	on	the	third	floor 1	but	she
is	nowhere	to	be	found 1	he	doesn’t	dare	try	any	of	the
other	closed	doors	on	the	third	floor 1	even	though	one	of
them	has	to	be	her	personal	residence 1	liam	had
mentioned	that	most	of	the	rooms	on	that	floor	are	empty
studios 1	but	damien	doesn’t	feel	comfortable	snooping
around	up	there 1
damien	asks	liam	about	his	contract	later	that	night
when	they	are	all	hanging	out	in	the	shared	living	space 1
sebastian	is	playing	the	same	fps	game	from	the
previous	night 1	and	damien	is	half-heartedly	watching	the
events	unfold	on	the	huge	tv	screen	as	liam	explains
more	about	life	at	the	café 1

liam	shrugs	when	damien	brings	up	the	contract 1	“it	doesn’t	mean	anything 1	“if	she	offered
you	a	contract 1	she’ll	show	up	with	it	eventually 1”	he	stuffs
a	handful	of	popcorn	into	his	mouth	and	then	offers
damien	the	bowl 1
damien	accepts	the	bowl 1	staring	down	at	it 1	he
wonders	what	liam	means	by	show	up	with	it 1	but	he
doesn’t	think	it’s	wise	to	press	too	much 1	obviously	there	is
more	to	melanie	than	meets	the	eye 1
sebastian	snorts	from	the	other	end	of	the	couch 1	but
doesn’t	make	any	further	comment 1	and	liam	goes	back	to
talking	about	a	client	he	had	last	week 1	damien’s	left
holding	the	popcorn 1	wondering	how	he’s	going	to	fit	into
all	of	this 1	until	liam	grabs	it	back	from	him	without	even
letting	damien	take	a	handful 1	damien	doesn’t	think	liam
even	noticed 1
the	next	day 1	damien	tries	to	make	a	point	to	track
melanie	down	to	talk	about	the	contract	again	with	no	luck 1
he	needs	to	know	what	his	role	at	the	café	will	be 1	he’s
starting	to	get	a	little	concerned	that	she	is	going	to	rescind
the	offer 1	no	matter	what	liam	says 1
liam	asks	for	his	help	taking	customer	orders 1
and	starts	training	him	on	the	espresso	machine 1	melanie
manages	to	make	herself	scarce	the	entire	day 1	it’s	like
every	time	he	sees	her 1	she’s	on	her	way	to	go	somewhere
else 1	or	when	she	seems	like	she	is	probably	free 1	he’s	in
the	middle	of	juggling	several	orders 1	the	way	she	is	able
to	avoid	him	is	almost…	magic 1	damien	thinks	ruefully 1
and	it	probably	is 1	if	the	woman	can	make	doors	that
appear	and	disappear	at	will 1	damien	wouldn’t	put
anything	past	her 1	damien	goes	straight	to	her	office	every
morning	that	entire	week	only	to	find	papers	moved
around 1	new	papers	added 1	and	a	growing	collection	of

colorful	coffee	cups	(grabbed	when	they	were	busy	with
customers	and	damien	couldn’t	take	a	moment	to	catch
her 1	naturally) 1	at	the	end	of	the	week 1	he	finds	a	credit
card	with	his	name	on	it	on	the	desk 1	along	with	a	note 1
buy	anything	you	need 1	it	says 1	damien	flips	the	card	over
and	over	in	his	hand 1	thinking	of	the	featureless	room
upstairs 1	thinking	of	all	of	the	stuff	he	left	in	seattle 1
he	pulls	liam	aside	when	they	have	a	slow	moment
and	shows	the	card	to	him 1
“seriously 1	it’s	yours 1	with	a	sympathetic
smile 1	“we	all	have	one 1	don’t	think	too	hard	about	this 1	it’s
just	how	she	is 1”
somehow	having	the	credit	card	makes	it	feel	official 1
even	though	it’s	not 1	damien	doesn’t	think	melanie
would	have	given	him	that	if	she	was	planning	on
rescinding	her	offer 1	but	damien	has	a	really	hard	time
figuring	out	what	melanie	gets	out	of	any	of	this 1	she’s	not
even	making	that	much	profit	off	of	the	hosts 1	if	any 1
damien	decides	he	might	as	well	use	the	card	since
she	gave	it	to	him	though 1	and	he	starts	making	purchases
here	and	there 1	just	to	test	the	waters 1	a	few	plants	for	his
room 1	black	slacks	and	black	button	ups	for	working	in	the
café 1	so	he	matches	liam 1	some	more	plants	for	the	living
area 1	to	brighten	it	up	a	bit 1	sebastian	rolls	his	eyes	at	that 1
but	it’s	not	like	he	has	to	take	care	of	them 1
damien	also	buys	a	comforter	that	reminds	him	of	the
one	he	left	in	seattle 1	it’s	covered	in	cute	cartoon	cats	and
much	more	appealing	than	the	plain	navy	one	he’s	using
now 1	when	it	arrives 1	it	hits	him	with	a	wave	of	nostalgia 1
and	even	though	it’s	only	been	a	few	weeks 1	he	wonders
what	his	roommate	did	with	all	of	his	old	stuff 1	she	had
stopped	messaging	him 1	her	last	message	just	says 1
whatever 3	i	hope	you	have	a	good	life 1	and	he
had	never	responded 1	he	deleted	the	entire	series	of

messages	out	of	the	app	on	his	phone	so	he	didn’t	have	to
look	at	them 1	but	he	kept	her	number 1
after	a	few	more	weeks 1	he	is	getting	used	to	life	at	the
café 1	sebastian	doesn’t	really	warm	up	to	him
exactly 1	but	damien	would	like	to	think	they	are	still	getting
to	know	each	other 1	damien	is	pretty	sure
sebastian	doesn’t	warm	up	to	anyone	except	his	lanky
friend	who	spends	way	too	much	time	in	the	café’s	lounge 1
damien	mostly	talks	with	liam 1	liam	spends	a	lot	of	their
down	time	narrating	stories	about	various	clients	he’s	had
over	the	years 1	and	damien	is	a	little	impressed	at	the
sheer	number	of	them 1	he	tries	to	get	more	information	out
of	liam	about	the	mysterious	doors	and	how	those	work 1
but	it	seems	like	even	liam	doesn’t	know	anything	about
the	mechanics	behind	them 1
apparently	they	just	appear 1	magically 1	they	show	up
on	a	blank	wall	in	the	room	when	you	are	taking	a	client 1
damien	had	somehow	walked	through	one 1	even	though
no	one	had	been	in	that	hosting	room	accepting	clients 1
not	impossible 1	given	the	fact	that	the	doors	are	quite
literally	magic	doors 1	but	unusual	nonetheless 1	liam	and
sebastian	had	apparently	found	the	café	through	different
means 1	although	neither	of	them	seemed	very	willing	to
talk	about	that 1
damien	will	get	it	out	of	them 1	eventually 1
damien	also	meets	the	handsome	doctor 1	elijah	hayes 1
who	stops	by	the	café	to	run	some	tests	on	all	of	them 1	eli
seems	a	little	surprised	to	meet	damien 1	but	tests	damien
all	the	same 1	damien	comes	back	clean 1	which	is
somewhat	of	a	relief 1	but	not	too	surprising	since	it’s	been
a	few	months 1	he’s	pronounced	ready	to	take	clients 1	but
he	doesn’t	have	a	contract 1	it’s	starting	to	get	annoying 1
really 2
after	nearly	two	months	of	working	in	the	café	without

any	sort	of	formal	contract	or	any	direction	from	melanie 1
damien	has	had	enough 1	he	is	starting	to	wonder	how
liam	and	sebastian	managed	by	themselves	without	him 1
melanie	seems	to	be	barely	keeping	the	café	business
running 1	he’s	not	sure	if	she’s	really	just	this	busy	all	of	the
time	or	if	she’s	actually	avoiding	him 1
one	morning 1	he	decides	to	stake	out	her	office	on	the
first	floor 1	he	is	determined	not	to	leave	until	he	can	get	the
contract	signed 1	even	after	the	café’s	been	open	for	a	few
hours 1	she	still	hasn’t	shown	up 1
damien	can’t	stand	to	sit	in	here	and	do	nothing 1	so	he
finds	himself	looking	through	all	of	the	papers	on	melanie’s
desk 1	a	few	weeks	ago 1	he	would	have	felt	too	nervous	to
do	this 1	but	he’s	gotten	over	that	quickly	after	living	and
working	here 1	most	of	the	papers	are	invoices	or	bills	for
the	building	(hopefully	paid) 1	but	there	is	also	tons	of
unopened	junk	mail	that	should	have	just	been	tossed 1	he
starts	organizing	it	all 1	because	if	he’s	not	out	helping
liam 1	he	might	as	well	be	doing	something 1
liam	brings	damien	coffee	every	once	in	a	while	when
the	front	area	is	slow 1	damien	skips	lunch 1	determined	that
melanie	has	to	show	up	sometime	and	continues	cleaning 1
liam	brings	him	in	a	plate	from	the	staff	lunch	sebastian
made	and	seems	impressed	at	damien’s	progress 1
whistling	lowly	at	the	state	of	melanie’s	office 1
by	the	time	melanie	shows	up 1	late	in	the	afternoon 1
her	office	is	spotless 1	her	desk	is	completely	cleared	off 1
the	piles	of	papers	and	empty	coffee	cups	are	nowhere	to
be	seen 1	all	of	the	files	are	organized	in	logical	groups	in
filing	cabinets 1	and	damien	is	convinced	that	what	melanie
really	needs	is	an	office	manager	more	than	another	host 1
“so	you’re	not	leaving 1”	melanie	says	when	she	opens
the	door 1	somehow	unsurprised	to	see	damien	in	her
office 1	she	probably	has	the	thing	bugged 1	he	guesses 1

damien	crosses	his	arms 1	frowning	at	her 1	“we	had	a
deal 1	“i’m	supposed	to	sign	a	contract 1”
melanie	gives	him	a	long	look 1	“you	are	still	certain	you
want	to	do	that 1”
damien	thinks	about	it 1	considering	his	options 1	which 1	there	is	nothing	to	think	about 1	he	nods 1	“yes 1”
he’s	all	in 1	he	supposes	the	past	two	months	have
given	him	more	time	to	think	about	it 1	and	he	doesn’t	feel
so	desperate	any	more 1	but	he	also	knows	that	this	is	his
best	shot	to	work	towards	a	fresh	start	for	himself 1
something	that	doesn’t	involve	all	of	his	parents’
expectations 1	something	that	can	be	just	for	him 1	alright 1	relenting 1	she	looks
around	her	office	for	the	first	time	since	she	stepped	in 1
and	she	presses	her	lips	together	in	a	very	thin	line 1
“you	know 1	“i	don’t	know	what	you	did	in
here 1	but	i’m	not	even	going	to	ask 1”	she	pulls	open	a
drawer	of	a	filing	cabinet	and	glances	through	a	few	of	the
folders 1	and	then	she	throws	her	hands	up 1	“i’m	never
going	to	find	anything	now 1”	she	points	at	him 1	“you	did
this 1	you’re	in	charge	of	keeping	it	like	this 1	smothering	a	laugh 1	he	somehow	doubts
she	was	ever	able	to	find	anything	in	the	mess	that	it	used
to	be	anyways 1	and	he	also	doubts	it	will	stay	this	spotless
for	long 1	but	he’ll	help	as	much	as	he’s	able 1
he	follows	her	up	to	her	third	floor	office 1	somehow 1	he
thinks 2	this	is	where	the	actual	business	is	run 1	if	anything
else 1	it	is	a	little	less	chaotic	up	here 1
“did	liam	tell	you	what	this	involves 1”	melanie	asks 1	as
she	sits	down	at	her	desk 1	pulling	open	a	drawer 1	damien
nods 1	he	had	asked	liam	tons	of	questions	over	the	last
two	months 1	and	liam	had	voluntarily	offered	information
about	things	damien	would	have	never	thought	to
consider 1

“blood 1”	he	confirms 1	it’s	a	blood	contract 1
she	nods 1	“i	need	it	for	the	magic 1”	she	explains 1	“the
door	will	be	tied	to	you	and	will	bring	you	clients	that	are
looking	for	what	you	can	provide	them 1”
he	shivers 1	almost	excited	about	the	prospect 1	it	can’t
be	any	worse	than	picking	up	strangers	in	a	club 1	liam	assured	him	that	he’s	never	had	a	bad
experience 1	sebastian	didn’t	say	much 1	but	sebastian
doesn’t	seem	like	the	type	of	guy	who	would	stick	around	if
it	was	truly	terrible 1
he	holds	out	his	hand 1	this	is	it 1
this	is	the	beginning 1

chapter	five
damien	sees	a	variety	of	different	clients	over	the
years 1	some	hold	longer	contracts	than	others 1	some	he
sees	for	only	a	night 1	never	to	see	them	again 1	damien	has
been	at	the	café	for	a	little	over	three	years	before	he
meets	him 1
it’s	a	thursday	like	any	other	thursday 1	damien	is	so
close	to	finally	paying	off	his	loans	from	law	school 1	he
thinks	it	will	happen	this	year 1	he	hasn’t	planned
anything	out	beyond	that 1	what	he	might	do	when	that
huge	weight	is	off	his	shoulders 1	what	his	life	might	be	like
when	he	doesn’t	have	to	take	clients	to	pay	the	loans
down 1
not	that	he	minds	taking	clients 1	he	also	has	fun
working	at	the	café 1	and	he	doesn’t	need	to	think	too	hard
about	the	future	while	he’s	working	here 1	he	manages
nearly	everything	for	the	legitimate	café	side	of	the
business 1	leaving	melanie	to	handle	the	hosting	contracts
and	all	of	the	coordination	with	clients 1	liam	and	even
sebastian	seem	more	than	happy	to	let	damien	take	care
of	all	of	the	operational	duties	around	the	café 1	sebastian
sticks	to	making	pastries	and	other	baked	goods 1	and	liam
mostly	works	as	a	barista 1	with	damien	helping	him	out

during	peak	hours 1
at	the	end	of	another	day 1	a	fairly	normal	thursday	as
far	as	café	life	goes 1	damien	is	helping	liam	clean	the
main	seating	area	after	closing 1	he	is	flipping	up	the	chairs
onto	the	tables	so	they	can	sweep	under	them 1	while	liam
wipes	down	the	counter	by	the	espresso	machine 1
“big	night	tonight 1”	liam	ribs	him	lightly 1	and	damien
smiles	to	himself 1
“not	necessarily…”	damien	replies 1	and	liam	grins	at
him 1	understanding	immediately 1
a	few	of	damien’s	contracts	ended	recently 1	so	he
doesn’t	actually	have	anyone	in	particular	lined	up	for
tonight 1	he	thinks	he’ll	probably	be	getting	some	new
clients	soon 1	he	half-wonders	if	he	should	cut	back	a	little 1
since	he’s	so	close	to	paying	off	his	debt 1	he’ll	cross	that
bridge	when	he	gets	there 1	no	use	worrying
about	it	now 1
“we’ll	see	if	anyone	interesting	shows	up 1”	damien
adds 1
liam	laughs	and	winks	at	him 1	“someone	always
does 1”
liam’s	not	wrong 1	damien	plans	on	waiting	in	his
favorite	hosting	room	tonight 1	seeing	if	the	magic	of	the
door	will	bring	someone	to	him 1	even	after	all	of	these
years 1	he’s	still	not	quite	sure	how	the	magic	doors	work 1
melanie	has	never	given	any	of	them	any	sort	of	proper
explanation 1	but	he	knows	that	if	he	waits	in	the	room
without	a	pre-arranged	client 1	a	door	will	bring	someone	to
him	if	it’s	a	good	match 1	and	the	surprise	of	it	is	part	of	the
fun 1
much	later	that	evening 1	damien	showers	in	the	private
bathroom	connected	to	his	room 1	now	understanding	why
there	wasn’t	a	hair	dryer	stocked	in	the	hotel	suite 1	the
showers	in	their	personal	rooms	are	almost	as	nice	as	the

ones	in	the	suite-style	rooms 1	if	a	little	less	spacious	and
definitely	not	as	luxurious 1	it’s	just	easier	for	damien	to	get
ready	in	his	own	space 1	and	he	imagines	it’s	the
same	for	the	other	guys 1
damien	prepares	his	body	in	advance 1
stretching	himself	out	with	careful	fingers	and	sliding	in	a
lubed	plug 1	on	nights	like	this	when	he	doesn’t	have	a
particular	client	lined	up 1	he	likes	to	be	ready	for	anything 1
it’s	hard	to	say	what	the	client	will	want	when	he	walks
through	the	door 1	some	of	them	are	a	little	confused 1	but
they	usually	get	into	the	swing	of	things	pretty	quickly
when	they	figure	out	what’s	going	on 1
he	waits	to	change	until	he	gets	into	the	luxurious	hotel
suite	that	he	prefers	to	host	clients	in 1	there	are	actually
several	other	types	of	rooms	available 1	but	damien
generally	sticks	with	this	one 1	it	makes	him	feel	like	a	high-
end	hooker	in	a	delicious	way 1	he	supposes	that’s	really
not	too	far	from	the	truth 1
when	he	gets	to	the	hosting	room 1	he	slips	out	of	his
clothes 1	folding	them	neatly	and	sliding	them	into	a	drawer 1
he’s	only	wearing	a	pair	of	black	silk	boxers 1	now 1	and	he’s
already	half-hard 1	his	dick	is	pushing	at	the	fabric	and
leaving	a	damp	spot 1	the	consistent	pressure	of	the	plug
keeping	him	stretched	open	is	tantalizing 1	and	he’s	excited
just	thinking	about	the	possibility	of	the	new	client 1	who
could	walk	through	the	door	tonight 1	what	will	he	look
like 1	damien	slides	a	matching	silk	robe	over	his
shoulders	from	the	closet	and	then	spreads	himself	over
the	huge 1	king-sized	bed 1	fantasizing	as	he	waits 1
the	door	only	appears	when	the	client	is	ready 1	some
nights	it	might	not	appear	at	all 1	and	those	nights	are
disappointing	to	say	the	least 1	damien	has	a	really	good
feeling	about	tonight	though 1
he’s	not	disappointed 1

a	door	appears	within	a	few	minutes	of	him	laying	down
on	the	bed 1	it	appears	in	between	breaths 1	as	if	it	had
always	existed	on	the	previously	blank	wall 1	damien’s	cock
starts	swelling	even	further	with	the	excitement	of	the
moment 1	his	anticipation	building	to	a	heady	point 1	he	has
to	restrain	himself	from	stroking	his	hard	length 1	best	to
wait 1	he	wants	to	savor	the	moment 1
what	will	this	man	look	like 1
the	door	opens 1
damien	sits	up	immediately	to	get	a	better	look	at	the
man	who	walks	through 1	the	client	is	dressed	like	a	typical
businessman 1	damien	thinks	at	first 1	dress	slacks 1	loafers 1
a	button	down	shirt 1	maybe	on	his	way	home	from	work
after	a	late	night	at	the	office 1
the	client’s	dark	grey	eyes	immediately	land	on
damien 1	and	his	interest	is	apparent 1	he	doesn’t	seem	as
confused	as	most	clients	are	when	they	walk	through	the
door 1	just	curious 1	his	hair	is	trimmed	short 1	nearly	too
short	to	tell	the	color	but	it	looks	like	it’s	dark	brown 1	maybe
running	closer	to	black 1	he’s	probably	a	few	inches	shorter
than	damien 1	but	he	is	built 1	quite	a	bit	more	muscular
than	damien	might	expect	for	a	businessman 1	his
strong	arms	are	clearly	defined	under	the	material	of	his
shirt 1	damien	licks	his	lips 1
the	client	is	damien’s	exact	type 1	to	an	excruciating
degree 1	damien’s	cock	is	ready	to	pop	out	of	his
silk	boxers 1	just	thinking	about	that	man’s	hands	on	his
skin 1	the	client’s	hot	gaze	takes	in	damien’s	entire	body 1
leaving	shivers	in	its	wake 1
damien	smiles 1	time	to	get	to	work 1	so	to	speak 1	at
least 1	nothing	about	this	is	going	to	feel	like	work 1	he	can
already	tell 1
“a	new	face 1	pleased 1	the	client’s	lips
quirk	up	into	a	hint	of	a	smile 1	but	it’s	gone	almost

immediately 1	the	man	doesn’t	make	a	move	to	step	further
into	the	room 1	stubborn 1	stubborn	he	can
work	with 1
damien	pushes	himself	off	of	the	bed	slowly 1	making	a
bit	of	a	show	out	of	it 1	the	silk	of	his	robe	gliding	against	his
skin	in	a	teasing	way 1	he	walks	closer	to	the	other	man 1
conscious	of	the	growing	damp	spot	in	his	boxers 1	he’s
never	had	this	immediate 1	visceral	reaction	to	a	client
before 1	and	it’s	too	delicious	to	ignore 1	offering	his	hand	out	to	the	other
man 1
the	client	doesn’t	take	it 1	he	shakes	his	head 1
and	damien	withdraws	his	hand 1	tilting	his	head	in
curiosity 1	clients	aren’t	required	to	share	their	names	with
the	hosts 1	but	most	of	them	do 1	or	at	least	a	pseudonym 1
some	more	obviously	fake	than	others 1	this	client’s
reaction	is	unusual 1	but	not	unprecedented 1	slightly	disappointed 1	this	will	probably	be	a	one
night	deal 1	feeling	oddly	sour	about	that 1	even
though	this	is	the	first	time	he’s	ever	seen	the	man 1	he
smiles	brightly	to	hide	his	thoughts 1	i	suppose	we	don’t	need	to	do	much	talking
anyways 1	do	we 1	and	finally	the	man	cracks	a
smile 1	melting	those	dark	grey	eyes	into	something	warm
and	liquid 1	damien’s	stomach	drops	in	a	hot	way 1	and	he
shivers 1
“you’ll	have	to	use	protection 1”	damien	continues 1	“but
we	can	do	whatever	you	want 1	as	long	as	it	doesn’t	leave	a
mark 1”	might	as	well	get	the	ground	rules	laid	out	and	get
to	work 1	even	if	this	is	a	one	time	deal 1	damien	can
already	tell	it’s	going	to	be	fun 1
the	client	still	hasn’t	said	anything 1	but	he	obviously
can’t	keep	his	eyes	off	of	damien 1	damien	starts	sliding
the	silk	robe	down	his	shoulders 1	and	the	man	reaches	out

to	run	a	rough	thumb	across	damien’s	skin 1	a	noise 1
almost	like	a	growl 1	comes	from	deep	within	the	client’s
chest 1	and	then	the	man’s	huge	hand	is	grabbing	damien’s
arm 1	pulling	him	in	for	a	searing	kiss 1	damien	melts	against
him 1	even	with	his	slight	height	difference 1	some	clients
don’t	do	this	either 1	but	he’s	oh 1	so	glad	this	client	does 1
the	client’s	mouth	is	hot	against	his 1	and	damien	can
feel	the	man’s	thick	cock	pressing	against	damien’s	thigh
through	the	material	of	the	business	slacks 1	damien	slides
his	hands	over	the	client’s	sides	and	down	to	his	belt 1
finding	the	buckle 1	the	man	knocks	damien’s	hand	away 1	stepping	back	and	unbuckling	himself 1	letting	his
slacks	hang	open	before	raising	his	hands	to	the	button	up
shirt 1
“get	on	the	bed 1”	the	man	says 2	voice	just	as	gruff	as
damien	had	expected	somehow 1	and	damien	can’t	stop
himself	from	grinning 1	the	client	is	practically	tearing	his
own	clothes	off 1	and	damien’s	surprised	he	doesn’t	lose	a
button	on	his	shirt 1
“mmm 1	how	do	you	want	me	then 1
excited	that	his	client	is	finally	talking 1	he	wishes	they
could	go	a	bit	slower 1	savor	this	more 1	but	he	has	a	feeling
that’s	not	what	this	is	about 1	this	is	going	to	be	fast	and
hard 1	and	damien’s	going	to	fucking	love	it 1
the	client	doesn’t	answer 1	so	damien	crawls	onto	the
bed	on	his	hands	and	knees 1	stretching	out	dramatically	to
show	off	his	toned	thighs 1	his	robe	is	still	sliding	halfway
down	his	shoulders 1	his	silk	boxers	are	still	covering	his
ass	and	obscuring	the	plug	he	has	holding	his	hole	open
and	ready 1	and	he’s	excited	to	see	the	client’s	reaction	to
that 1
the	man’s	large	hands	are	on	his	back	then 1	pushing
the	robe	up	to	damien’s	shoulders	and	pressing	down
hard	enough	that	damien’s	elbows	buckle	and	his	head

ends	up	on	his	crossed	arms 1
clients	so	rarely	take	initiative	like	this 1	it’s…
refreshing 1	it’s	almost	like	damien	is	the	client 1	but	damien
has	no	real	illusions	about	that 1	none	of	this	is	about	him
specifically 1	it’s	about	something	the	client	needs 1	and	that
something	just	happens	to	come	in	the	package	of
damien’s	body 1	it’s	part	of	the	whole	deal 1	damien	may
never	see	this	man	again	after	tonight 1	so	he’s
going	to	let	himself	enjoy	it 1
the	client’s	hands	stroke	down	damien’s	back 1
massaging	into	the	meat	of	his	ass	through	damien’s
boxers 1	the	man’s	thumb	strokes	across	damien’s	crack 1
catching	on	the	plug	there 1	and	the	man	groans 1
“you’re	–”	the	man	says 1	but	doesn’t	finish	the	thought 1
he	pulls	damien’s	boxers	down	roughly 1	leaving	them
pooled	around	damien’s	knees	on	the	bed	and	pushes
damien’s	thighs	open	so	his	legs	are	half-trapped	in	the
fabric 1	damien’s	cock	is	rock	hard	now 1	bouncing	against
his	stomach	occasionally	with	the	movements 1	smearing
precum	on	the	skin	there 1
and	then	the	man	bites	him 1	right	on	his	ass 1”	damien	half	yelps 1	indignant 1	he	just	told	the
man	not	to	leave	any	marks 1
the	client	chuckles 1	obviously	somehow
amused	by	damien’s	protest 1	“be	still 1	brat 1
running	his	thumb	over	the	plug	again	and	pushing	on	it
slightly 1	damien	holds	back	a	groan	of	his	own	at	that 1	the
client’s	tone	is	light	and	teasing 1	and	damien	immediately
forgives	him 1	he	doubts	the	bite	was	hard	enough	to	leave
a	mark	anyways 1
“just	look	at	you 1”	the	client	breathes 1	obviously
enjoying	what	he’s	seeing 1	“like	a	pretty	present 1	all	ready
for	me 1”
damien	finds	himself	nodding	against	his	arms 1	his

indignation	over	the	bite	completely	forgotten	now 1	they
haven’t	even	really	done	anything	yet 1	and	damien	feels

with	a	client 1	no	less 1
the	client	sits	back	and	chuckles	again 1	the	low	sexy
noise	goes	straight	to	damien’s	cock 1	but	let’s	be	honest 1
what	wouldn’t	right	now 1	damien	finally	feels	the	plug	slide
out	from	his	hole 1	tossed	aside	for	now 1	he	tries	to	push

back	down 1

that	it’s	not	even	possible	for	a	man	to	make	that	sort	of
sound 1

nearly	all	of	his	weight	now	as	the	man’s	pace	increases	to
something	nearly	brutal	momentarily	before	he	groans 1
